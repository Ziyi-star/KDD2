OPTICS creates an ordering of a database, 
stoing the core distance and reachability distance for each object

main loop of the algorithm OPTICS

At the beginning, we open a file OrderedFile for writing and close this file after ending the loop.
Each object from a database SetOfObjects is simply handed over to a procedure ExpandClusterOrder if the object is not yet processed.

OPTICS (SetOfObjects, E, MinPts, OrderedFile)
	OrderedFile.open();
	FOR i FROM 1 TO SetOfObjectssize DO
		Object := SetOfObjects.get(i);
		IF NOT Object.Processed THEN
			ExpandCIusterOrder(SetOfObjects, Object, E, MinPts, OrderedFile)
OrderedFile.close();
END;
